# Snake-game-trained-using-AI
in this Project we will train a snake game to play on its own using Artificial Intelligence. In this project we will use python language and Pytorch, Pygame.



I am assuming that you have installed Python and its Basic feautrea. if you have installed python then only proceed. If you havent installed python you can install it by following tutorials on Youtube.




We will run this project in anaconda terminal.

First install anaconda by visiting this website https://www.anaconda.com/download
After installing anaconda open anaconda terminal.

lets install some directories by following some simple command.

open anaconda terminal and type pip install pytorch.

after installation completed type pip install pygame.


download my repository in zip file and unzip it in a specific folder.

now open the folder and copy the address of the folder by right clicking on the address bar and select copy address.

now open Anaconda terminal and type cd and your copied address

now type conda activate pygame_env

and at last type python agent.py


now your Snake AI game is started playing on its own and a graph tab is open to show its performances game by game.
after 200 games you can definetly see how AI improves.
